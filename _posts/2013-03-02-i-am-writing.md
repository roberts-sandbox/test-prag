I have decided to write.  I want to write because I think writing is the best way for me to remember what I learn better.  I realize that I am taking a big risk here, because I will for sure either make mistakes or misunderstand something or both and therefore I would be just exposing my weaknesses.  Future employers will want to learn more about me, and what I am capable of.  If what I am writing here is garbage, there goes my chance of getting employed.  Realistically, I don't expect that I would get many readers.  Does anyone not know that are so many information, articles, blogs, etc out there on the Internet?  Everyone is competing to have the articles read and sites visited by the maximum number of audience.  But if I don't write and don't take the chance, I will always be in the dark and will never get better.  I am just hoping that the rewards will eventually outweight the risks.  

I am also the hardest critics of myself.  I only hope that my knowledge will continue to grow which I think that's the case for everyone, no exception.  I hear a common saying "Oh, I am too old to learn now" and I think that can never really be true.  From the moment one is born, he or she will constantly gain more knowledge and know more things.  No one can unknow what they knew.  That's my argument that everyone can learn and is learning each and every day.  The drawback from this continuous learning theory for me: a year from now, I will look back at what I am writing right now, and say "What was I thinking?".  Heck, maybe not even a year now, maybe next month.  This is another reason that has prevented from trying to write, because nothing I ever wrote ever looked perfect.  

One of the smartest persons in my profession whom I really admire, [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/), once said "The word 'essay' comes from the French essayer, meaning 'to try'...writing an essay is about trying out your ideas.".  So here is where I am trying out my ideas.

So go ahead and criticize me.  Better yet, correct me and help me understand.  Praising won't hurt my feelings either but is rather very welcomed.  That's what the comments box is for.

Until my next post...
