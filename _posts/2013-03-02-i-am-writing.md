I have decided to write.  I want to write because I think writing is the best way for me to remember what I learn better.  I realize that I am taking a big risk here, because I will for sure either make mistake or misunderstand something or both and therefore I would be just exposing what I am not capable of doing.  But I am just hoping that the rewards will eventually outweight the risks.  

I am also the hardest critics of myself.  I only hope that my knowledge will continue to expand.  The drawback is that a year from now, I will look back at what I am writing right now, and say "What was I thinking?".  Heck, maybe not even a year now, maybe next month.

One of the smartest persons in my profession whom I really admire, [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/), once said "The word 'essay' comes from the French essayer, meaning 'to try'...writing an essay is about trying out your ideas.".
